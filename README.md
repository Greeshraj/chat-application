### Chatterbox Application: System Design Document

---

#### **1. Introduction**

**Chatterbox** is a real-time messaging application that allows users to chat in personal or group conversations. Additionally, it integrates an AI tool (ChatGPT) to provide users with AI-generated responses when they start their message with `@gpt`. The application supports multimedia sharing and video calls, ensuring a comprehensive communication experience.

#### **2. System Architecture**

**2.1 Overview**

The Chatterbox application is built using a microservices architecture, with each component focusing on a specific function, ensuring scalability, modularity, and ease of maintenance. The architecture leverages modern web technologies and third-party services to provide a seamless experience.

**2.2 Components**

1. **Client-Side (Frontend):**
   - **Next.js (App Router)**: Used as the primary framework for rendering the React components and managing routing. Next.js is chosen for its server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities and built-in API routes, which help in optimizing performance.
   - **ShadCN**: A UI component library used to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface. ShadCN was chosen for its customizability and ease of integration with Tailwind CSS.
   - **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for styling components with utility-first CSS classes. Tailwind is selected for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of creating responsive designs.
   - **TypeScript**: Used to add type safety and catch errors early in development, enhancing code maintainability.

2. **Backend:**
   - **Convex**: Acts as the backend database, real-time event handler, and cloud function provider. Convex is chosen for its ability to handle complex data operations, real-time synchronization, and serverless deployment, which simplifies infrastructure management.
   - **Convex File Storage**: Used for storing and managing multimedia files like images and videos uploaded by users. It integrates seamlessly with Convex's database and real-time capabilities.

3. **User Authentication:**
   - **Clerk**: Provides user authentication and session management. Clerk is chosen for its out-of-the-box support for various authentication methods, making it easy to manage user accounts securely.

4. **Video Calls:**
   - **ZegoCloud**: Enables video calling functionality within the application. ZegoCloud is selected for its reliable real-time communication features and easy integration with web applications.

5. **AI Integration:**
   - **OpenAI GPT-4**: Integrated for providing AI-generated responses when users start their message with `@gpt`. OpenAI's GPT model is chosen for its advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities.

#### **3. Data Flow**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users log in via Clerk, which authenticates them and creates a session.
   - Clerk manages user credentials and sessions, sending events to Convex via webhooks to sync user data.

2. **Chat Functionality:**
   - Users send messages through the frontend, which are stored in Convex's database.
   - Real-time synchronization ensures all participants in a conversation see new messages immediately.

3. **AI Responses:**
   - When a message starts with `@gpt`, the system triggers a function that sends the message to the OpenAI API.
   - The response is then sent back to the chat and displayed to the user.

4. **Video Calls:**
   - Users initiate video calls through the frontend, which interacts with ZegoCloud for real-time audio and video streaming.
   - ZegoCloud handles the media stream, while Convex manages call metadata (participants, call duration, etc.).

5. **File Storage:**
   - Media files shared in the chat are uploaded to Convex File Storage.
   - URLs for the files are stored in the Convex database, allowing users to retrieve and view shared media.

#### **4. Deployment Process**

**4.1 Setting Up the Environment**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
   
2. **Configure Convex:**
   - Run `npm run dev` to log into Convex and create a project.

3. **Set Up Clerk:**
   - Create a Clerk account and obtain the `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.
   - Add these keys to the `.env.local` file.
   - Obtain the `CLERK_ISSUER_URL` and set it in the Convex environment variables as `CLERK_ISSUER_URL` and `CLERK_HOST_NAME`.
   - Add a webhook in Clerk's dashboard pointing to `https://your-convex-url.convex.site/clerk` for `user.created`, `user.updated`, `session.created`, and `session.ended` events.

4. **Configure OpenAI:**
   - Create an OpenAI account and get the `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
   - Add the key to the Convex environment variables.

5. **Configure ZegoCloud:**
   - Create a ZegoCloud account, set up a project for voice and video calls, and obtain the `ZEGO_APP_ID` and `ZEGO_SERVER_SECRET`.
   - Add these to your `.env.local` file.

**4.2 Running the Application**

1. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
2. The application should now be running locally with all functionalities, including user authentication, chat, AI responses, file storage, and video calls.

**4.3 Deployment to Production**

- For production deployment, deploy the Next.js app to a service like Vercel or Netlify.
- Ensure that all environment variables are correctly set in the deployment platform.
- Convex and Clerk services should be configured for production URLs and credentials.
